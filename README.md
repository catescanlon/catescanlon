ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @catescanlon

I'm training to be a clinical researcher studying the brain its related disorders. 

I've always loved to code, and am trying to introduce this passion and skill of mine into psychology whenever I can.

I am especially interested in alogrithims and machine learning, and have started a project on them!
